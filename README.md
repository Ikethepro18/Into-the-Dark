# What Is This?
This is a Mincraft Fabric mod for 1.20.1 which will eventually include all planets and moons within our solar system as their own unique dimension. It will not include any methods to visit them (other than /execute in itd:{dimension} run tp @s ~ ~ ~) because it is designed to work in tandem with [Adventures in Time](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait), although it is not dependent on it so you can use it with other mods

## Adventures in Time?
This mod is designed around use with [Adventures in Time](https://modrinth.com/mod/ait), an incredibly good mod that "Adds the TARDIS from Doctor Who into Fabric 1.20.1". By using ITD with AIT, you can select the planets and moons etc. using the Dimension selector on the TARDIS Console and then simply travel there. In the future, there is room for this mod to expand or branch to add in Whoniverse specific planets, structures, items and more. For now though, it'll remain grounded in reality

## Can I Use This?
Yes you can use this mod in your modpack, or tweak and remix it in your own way if you'd like. Do bear in mind though it is licensed under [CC-BY-SA-4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/), so take that into consideration if you do plan on using it
